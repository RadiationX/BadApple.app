# Bad Apple but it's a macOS virus

This is a port of [Bad Apple but it's a Windows virus](https://github.com/mon/bad_apple_virus).

All assets taken from that repo. Big thx to this gigachad [mon](https://github.com/mon).

Video demonstration:

## Why is it not so performant as Windows version?

- macOS doesn't have such flags to control window rendering.
- Swift is not Rust ðŸ˜¢

## Building and such

Open in Xcode and run.

If you want to change boxes.bin, follow instruction in [Bad Apple but it's a Windows virus](https://github.com/mon/bad_apple_virus?tab=readme-ov-file#building-and-such) and replace boxes.bin.
